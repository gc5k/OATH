# Open gwAs algoriTHm [OATH]
This github contains the raw data and demonstration used in the original publication of OATH.

1 How to get the data
Please either "git clone https://github.com/gc5k/OATH.git" to have the whole data cloned to your local computer, or download it (notice the "clone or download‚Äù, a green button?)

2 System requirement
OATH has already been realized in GEAR [GEnetic Analysis Repository; gear.jar]. 
More details about GEAR can be found https://github.com/gc5k/GEAR/wiki.
gear.jar is developed in java, and it is able to run on various operating systems as long as java is installed.
gear needs Java 7, or above, to be installed on your computer. Type "java -version" to check the details. If it shows "java 1.7" or "java 1.8", then your computer is ready, otherwise please download java online and install it first (from oracle website).


3 R scripts
There are three demonstrations included.
a) DemonFig2 has an R script to generate Fig 2 as in the paper; and also it shows the kernel of OATH. Run Figure2Demo.R.
b) ArabData has the cleaned genotype data for generating results for Fig 6. Although genotype data are not really needed by OATH, to provide a more comprehensive experience for users we still include the data for 295 Arabidopsis lines. Run ArabAnalysis_Fig6.R
c) GWAMA analysis. Naive summary statistics provided two Chinese GWAS cohorts: NAcohort and SLEcohort. Run GWAMA_Fig7.R.
